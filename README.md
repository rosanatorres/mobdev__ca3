## Task: Mobile Development:

The objective of this assignment is to create an Ionic app that can consume the Breaking Bad API https://breakingbadapi.com and display data in four categories: characters, episodes, quotes, and death count.

## The following steps were taken to complete the app:

- Set up the environment: utilise GitPod scripting to automatically pre-install Ionic and Angular CLI, install modules and plugins, generate the required pages and service(s);
- Set up the core app aspects: routing, tabs and introduce a Back-Navigation functionality for all the required tab subpages (Characters and Episodes);
- Consume API data: use Observables, ngFor and ngIf logic provided by Angular;
- Improve the design: change the default Ionic UI, theming & CSS variables and showcase the ability to use appropriate Ionic Icons for the tabs;
- Possess a coherent commit history on GitHub.
